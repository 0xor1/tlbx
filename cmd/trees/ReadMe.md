trees
=====

[Live app](https://task-trees.com)

A project management app where tasks are stored in tree structures, the time and cost values estimated and incurred on each task
are rolled up the task tree to the root node, so each node contains a full summary of all the time and cost estimates and incurred
values at all times, making issues with large scale project management more visible.
